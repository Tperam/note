|                                     |             |                                                              |

**例句**

Mr. McWhorter's academic specialty is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of "whom", for example, to be natural and nor more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.

麦克沃特先生在学术上专攻语言史和语言变化。例如：他把“whom”的逐渐消失看成是自然而然的过程，与古英语中次格尾缀的消失一样毫不可惜。

But his primary task is **not** to think about the moral code, which governs his activity, **any more than** a business man is expected to dedicate energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business.

- not ... any more than

his primary task 为 A

to think about the moral code 去思考道德边界线

which governs his activity 工作范围

business man 为 B 

expected to dedicate energies  期望投入精力

exploration of rules of conduct 指挥的规则的探索

in business 在商业中

他的工作不是去思考道德边界线，与商人一样，不是在商业中去投入精力去探索指挥规则

但是，他的首要任务并不是考虑支配自己行动的道德规范，就如同不能指望商人专注于探讨商业行为规范一样。
